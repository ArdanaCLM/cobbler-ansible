# This task runs a module on localhost that extracts networking information
# from the baremetal section of the model and returns it in a convenient struct
# that is consumed by various other plays. I'm using run_once because this task
# might get run against a bunch of nodes in parallel. That's not dangerous or
# anything, but they'd all get the same answer (because they're all working
# with the same source data from localhost) so it's pointless repetition.
# Run once, we don't even care on what node; the result will be the same.
