# This task uses the bminfo struct from get-baremetal-info.yml to derive a
# bunch of convenience variables that are used in various other plays. It then
# goes further and figures out the name of the network interface that Cobbler
# is using, by comparing the baremetal CIDR specified in the model with the
# actual values in "ip a" on localhost.
